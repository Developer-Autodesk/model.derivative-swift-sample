* Upload a file to bucket
* Start translation
* Get thumbnail

##Dependencies

This requires the latest Xcode that supports the Swift language. At the moment itâ€™s Xcode6.1.1

##Setup/Usage Instructions

* Before running the app, change the "bucketKey" variable to something unique - it won't function if your bucket name collides with someone else's
* Type in the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret in the dialog that you got for your application on [https://developer.autodesk.com](https://developer.autodesk.com) 
* Generate Token - this is required before doing any further operation  
* Upload a file for translation
* When a urn (id of a given uploaded file) is selected in the combo box, then the dialog will try to retrieve and display  its thumbnail
* Next, use other web applications samples like [the Basic Node.Js sample](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/workflow-node.js-view.and.data.api) to view the models.
